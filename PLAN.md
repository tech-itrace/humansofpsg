# Humans of PSG — Project Plan

## 1. Purpose

A maintainable static blog that publishes short, first-person human-interest
stories about PSG alumni around the world, in the editorial style of Humans
of Bombay — one subject, one portrait, one narrative per post — rather than
the multi-category magazine style of PSG Tech's own publication, The Bridge,
which was reviewed for reference but is not the model this project follows.

This repo is public, so all naming, examples, and sample content below use
"Humans of PSG" as the project identity, scoped to the PSG College of
Technology community worldwide — not any one city. A subject's city,
neighborhood, and department may still appear as `city`/`location`/
`department` values on individual stories, but PSG alumni everywhere are the
project's scope, not a single geography.

## 2. Reference sites analyzed

### thebridge.psgtech.ac.in ("The Bridge")
- Ghost-CMS-powered official PSG Tech magazine.
- Category-driven navigation (Careers, Interviews, Sci Tech, Entrepreneurship, ...).
- Homepage is a grid of featured cards: avatar, category tag, title, "time ago • read time".
- Individual posts use a two-column hero (portrait left, colored panel with
  title/subtitle/byline right), followed by long-form Q&A interview text,
  author bio, "Recommended for you" related posts, and a newsletter CTA.
- Good reference for: card grid layout, tag/category browsing, related-posts pattern.
- Not the right content shape for this project: it's interview/Q&A and multi-topic,
  not single-subject narrative.

### humansofbombay.in ("Humans of Bombay")
- Storytelling platform, not a magazine. Minimal chrome.
- Blog grid of story cards: photo + title + short excerpt + "Read More".
- Story page: one large portrait (often black-and-white), then a first-person
  narrative with no Q&A structure and minimal byline emphasis, a short closing
  "brand" paragraph, a "Recent posts" sidebar, and social share icons.
- Content is short, emotional, one-subject-per-post.
- This is the content/UX model "Humans of PSG" should follow.

## 3. Content model

One Markdown file per story, with frontmatter validated at build time so a
missing photo or name fails the build instead of shipping broken.

```
src/content/stories/riza-and-her-sister.md
---
name: "Riza"
slug: riza-and-her-sister
photo: /images/stories/riza-and-her-sister/cover.jpg
photoAlt: "Riza and her sister"
location: "Mylapore"          # Neighborhood the story is rooted in
city: "Chennai"                # Chennai, Bengaluru, Los Angeles, Delhi, ...
department: "Computer Science" # optional — academic department
expertise: "Founder"           # optional — Management, Founder, Mentor, ...
category: "Family"            # e.g. Family, Work, Migration, Craft, Alumni (PSG etc.)
pullQuote: "What makes her special is everything but her condition."

---
Story body in first person, Markdown...
```

A Zod schema in `src/content.config.ts` enforces this shape.

## 4. Tech stack

- **Astro** — content collections for stories, plain `.astro` components for
  layout. No client-side JS framework needed; this is 100% static content.
- **Homepage** — grid of story cards (photo, name, pull-quote, "Read story"),
  following the Humans of Bombay blog-grid pattern.
- **Story page** — full-bleed portrait, then narrative text, then a "More
  stories" rail, restyled with Humans of PSG brand colors/typeface.
- **Tag/area/category pages** (e.g. `/tag/mylapore`, `/tag/psg-tech`)
  generated automatically from frontmatter, for browsing by neighborhood,
  theme, or institution without adopting The Bridge's full magazine chrome.

## 5. Authoring workflow (non-technical contributors)

- **Decap CMS** at `/admin`, configured against the same `stories` collection
  schema as the Zod schema, so the CMS form and validation never drift apart.
- **Editorial workflow mode** — a contributor's submission becomes a draft PR
  (`status: draft`); it's reviewed on GitHub (photo + text diff) before merge
  to `main` publishes it. No direct-to-main writes from volunteers.
- **Auth caveat** — GitHub Pages serves static files only, so Decap's
  GitHub-backend login needs a small OAuth proxy. Deploy the standard
  `decap-cms-oauth-provider` as a free Cloudflare Worker or Vercel function.
  This is the one non-static piece of the project, and it only handles login,
  not content storage (content still lives in the git repo).

## 6. Build & deploy

- GitHub Actions: on push to `main`, run `astro build`, deploy via
  `actions/deploy-pages` to GitHub Pages.
- Image handling via Astro's built-in `<Image>` component for automatic
  resizing/optimization, since contributor photos will vary widely in size.
- Auto-generated sitemap and a per-story OG image (name + pull-quote over the
  portrait) so shared links render well on WhatsApp/Instagram.

## 7. Phasing

1. Scaffold the Astro project, content schema, homepage grid, and story page
   templates. Seed with 3–5 real stories written directly as Markdown.
2. Wire up GitHub Actions deploy to GitHub Pages.
3. Add Decap CMS, the OAuth proxy, and the editorial workflow for volunteer
   contributions.
4. Polish: tag pages, RSS feed, OG image generation, and a CONTRIBUTING.md
   documenting both the git route and the `/admin` route for contributors.

## 8. Open items / decisions deferred

- Final visual design (Humans of PSG brand colors/typeface) not yet chosen.
- Whether a custom domain will be used for GitHub Pages.
- Moderation policy for volunteer-submitted stories beyond "reviewed via PR".
